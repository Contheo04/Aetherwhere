# **Aetherwhere** 🌍
*A Work-in-Progress Dalamud Plugin for Tracking Aether Currents*  

## **About**  
*Aetherwhere* is a **Dalamud plugin** designed to help players track and locate **Aether Currents** in *Final Fantasy XIV*. Inspired by **[Heavenswhere](http://heavenswhere.com)** (*RIP, great site*) and **[Hunty](https://github.com/Infiziert90/Hunty)**, this plugin provides an **in-game UI** for managing and navigating Aether Currents efficiently.  

### **Status: Work in Progress (WIP) 🚧**  
This plugin is actively being developed and is still in its early stages. **New features and UI improvements are being added regularly.**

## **Features (Planned & Implemented)**  
✔ **Expansion & Zone Selection** – Navigate through different expansions and zones  
✔ **Aether Current Locations** – Displays all known Aether Current coordinates  
✔ **Quest vs. Exploration Currents** – Differentiates between quest-locked and exploration-based currents  
✔ **Collection Tracking (Future Feature)** – Marks which currents have been collected  
✔ **Map Marker Integration (Future Feature)** – Click coordinates to set in-game map markers

## **Inspiration & Credits**  
This plugin was **built on top of the Sample Plugin** provided by **[Dalamud.dev](https://dalamud.dev/)** and takes inspiration from:  

- **[Heavenswhere](http://heavenswhere.com)** (*Now inactive, but was an amazing resource for tracking Aether Currents!*)  
- **[Hunty](https://github.com/Infiziert90/Hunty)** (*FFXIV Hunting Log tracking plugin, helped shape UI elements and interactions*)  

Big thanks to the **Dalamud & FFXIV Plugin Dev Community** for their tools and documentation! 🎉
